				<section>Intented Audience. Those interested in playing with mindstorms or brickpi with perl 5 / 6. I hope you are interested in hearing about my experience trying this out. Because you really can figure out a lot of this on your own by searching the internet.</section>

                <section>Tried Ev3dev on BrickPi3 but didn't work so tried Raspbian for Robots</section>
                <section>Raspian for Robots Quality of Life additions (like vim instead of just vi for those that like vi/vim, and using vim as git's core editor)</section>
                <section>Don't pull the SD out of a BrickPi3 while the case is still on</section>
                <section>If BrickPi3 hat isn't working try updating firmware https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3/tree/master/Firmware. Talk about my experience with support from Dexter Industries.</section>
                <section>g++ segmentation fault (program cc1plus). g++ just not working :/. gcc was though and leared you could run c++ code using libstdc++. So installed "sudo aptitude install 'libstdc++6'" with the intent of using gcc. In the process of that other things were updated that lead to g++ to start working!</section>
                <section>learning SWIG. when starting out (and if your c/c++ is rusty like mine) commit to gcc or g++. started small just to learn swig basics then tried to convert BrickPi3.</section>
                <section>Perl 5 on Mindstorms</section>
                <section>Mindstorms Bricks aren't the most speedy of devices (talk about specs) so you might want to write your code tdd style with mocking on something else</section>
                <seciont>If that something else isn't the enviroment ev3.pm was compiled under. You will get this error "Can't locate loadable object for module ev". So try something like Docker (this is happy because ev3dev has docker recipes in dockerhub)</section>
                <section>The ev3dev-c perl examples are helpful.. https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c/tree/master/perl</section>
